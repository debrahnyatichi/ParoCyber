# Assignment 2: Nmap & Scapy Lab

## Overview

This assignment documents hands-on reconnaissance, enumeration, OSINT, network analysis, and packet manipulation exercises conducted using industry-standard tools such as **Nmap** and **Scapy**.

The focus of this lab was to understand how attackers and defenders gather intelligence, analyze network traffic, and identify exposed services in real-world cybersecurity environments.
