# Assignment 2: Nmap & Scapy Lab

## Overview

This assignment involved reproducing practical labs using **Nmap** and **Scapy** to understand network discovery, service enumeration, OS fingerprinting, and packet-level interaction.

The objective was to move beyond tool usage and understand **how and why these techniques work** in real-world cybersecurity engagements.

---

## Objectives

- Perform host discovery and port scanning using Nmap
- Identify services and operating systems on target hosts
- Use Nmap scripting for basic enumeration
- Craft, send, and sniff packets using Scapy
- Analyze network traffic at the protocol level

---

## Environment Setup

- Operating System: Linux (Kali / Parrot OS)
- Tools:
  - Nmap
  - Python 3
  - Scapy
- Target: Authorized lab environment / test network

---

## Nmap Lab Summary

The following Nmap scans were executed and documented:

- Host discovery (ICMP, ARP, TCP-based)
- Port scanning (TCP SYN, full connect)
- Service and version detection
- OS fingerprinting
- Basic NSE scripting

---

## Scapy Lab Summary

Using Scapy, the following exercises were performed:

- Packet crafting (IP, TCP, ICMP)
- Sending and receiving packets
- Sniffing live network traffic
- Basic protocol analysis
- Understanding packet fields and flags

---

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Network reconnaissance is foundational to both attack and defense
- Nmap provides critical visibility into exposed services and systems
- Scapy enables low-level packet manipulation beyond standard tools
- Understanding traffic behavior improves detection and response capabilities
- Proper documentation is essential for professional security work

---

## Disclaimer

All scans and packet analysis were conducted in **authorized lab environments only**.  
Unauthorized scanning or packet manipulation is illegal and unethical.
